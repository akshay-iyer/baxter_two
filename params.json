{"name":"Baxter Pick 'n' Place","tagline":"","body":"## About ##\r\n\r\nA ROS project developed as part of ME495 - Embedded Systems in Robotics course at Northwestern University (NU). \r\n\r\nTo launch (in a ROS workspace), type in terminal:\r\n```\r\ncd ~/baxter_ws/\r\n. baxter.sh\r\nrosrun baxter_tools enable_robot.py -e\r\nroslaunch baxter_two baxter_two.launch\r\n```\r\n\r\n## Goal of Project ##\r\n\r\n**Use baxter to pick and place objects from one location to another**\r\n\r\n## Tutorial ##\r\n\r\nThe following sections describe contents of this package and how to use them:\r\n\r\n### 1. Prerequisites ###\r\n\r\nThe following packages need to be installed for `baxter_two` package to work: \r\n\r\n1. [Baxter SDK] - to be installed in baxter_ws/src directory\r\n2. [MoveIt!]\r\n3. [moveit_python] by Michael Ferguson - to be installed in `baxter_ws/src` directory\r\n4. [Baxter Simulator] - v1.1 (ONLY needed if NOT working with actual baxter robot)\r\n\r\n### 2. Package Contents ###\r\n\r\nThe `baxter_two` package consists of following main files:\r\n\r\n* **baxter_two.launch**: A launch file that starts the following nodes:\r\n\t* joint_action_trajectory_server.py (required for MoveIt!)\r\n\t* MoveIt! with rviz\r\n\t* baxter_img.cpp\r\n\t* baxter_pnp.py\r\n\r\n* **baxter_img.cpp**: subscribes to the `/cameras/right_hand_camera/image` topic, calculates object locations using [OpenCV] tools, and publishes this information to `baxter_pnp` node via a `PoseArray()` message\r\n\r\n* **baxter_pnp.py**: subscribes to the topic (called `Dpos`) published by *baxter_img*, and calls `PlanningSceneInterface` and `MoveGroupInterface` classes from `moveit_python` bindings to add collision objects and move baxter's arms respectively\r\n\t* Allows both arms to be moved at the same time\r\n\t* Allows velocity scaling using `max_velocity_scaling_factor`\r\n\t* Uses `baxter_interface` for gripper control\r\n\r\n### 3. Step-by-step guide ###\r\n\r\nThis section gives a step-by-step approach to run a successful baxter pick and place with this package.\r\n\r\n1. Items needed - a table of height ~ 0.6 m; square blocks (with green top surface); a baxter robot with electric parallel grippers; an ethernet cable (to connect baxter to computer)\r\n2. Set up [networking] with baxter\r\n3. Install the required packages as outlined in **Prerequisites** section\r\n4. Clone this package to your `baxter_ws/src` directory\r\n5. [Source] `baxter.sh` file, enable the robot, and launch `baxter_two.launch` as follows\r\n\t\r\n```\r\ncd ~/baxter_ws/\r\n. baxter.sh\r\nrosrun baxter_tools enable_robot.py -e\r\nroslaunch baxter_two baxter_two.launch\r\n```\r\n\r\n### 4. rqt_graph ###\r\n\r\nThe following rqt_graph shows a ROS computation graph for baxter pick and place highlighting all important nodes and topics during operation:\r\n\r\n<img src=\"/bin/rosgraph.png\" align=\"middle\" width=\"300\">\r\n\r\n## Future Work ##\r\n\r\n* **Camera Calibration**: We are looking into improving the camera calibration. Currently, variations in surrounding lighting affect the object detection. Using more finely-tuned methods of calibrating the camera will minimize the lighting issue. \r\n\r\n* **GUI Development**: We are also looking to create a Graphical User Interface (GUI) that allows the user to click an object in the virtual world (e.g in [Gazebo]), and pick and place that particular object. This GUI is currently under development.\r\n\r\n## Team ##\r\n\r\n* [Abhishek Patil]\r\n* Alan Hong\r\n* Hanlin Wang\r\n* Vince Martinez\r\n\r\n[Baxter SDK]: http://sdk.rethinkrobotics.com/wiki/Workstation_Setup\r\n[MoveIt!]: http://moveit.ros.org/install/\r\n[moveit_python]: https://github.com/mikeferguson/moveit_python\r\n[Baxter Simulator]: http://sdk.rethinkrobotics.com/wiki/Simulator_Installation\r\n[OpenCV]: http://opencv.org/\r\n[networking]: http://sdk.rethinkrobotics.com/wiki/Networking\r\n[source]: http://sdk.rethinkrobotics.com/wiki/Workstation_Setup\r\n[Gazebo]: http://www.gazebosim.org/tutorials?tut=ros_installing&cat=connect_ros\r\n[Abhishek Patil]: https://github.com/patilnabhi\r\n","google":"","note":"Don't delete this file!
